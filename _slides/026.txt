Title: "Domestic B Envelope"
---
1. The domestic B envelope is found inside the domestic outer mailer.  The ballot is found inside the B envelope. 
 
*	If there is no B envelope, this is a material omission and the ballot will be rejected.
*	If the ballot is not inside the B envelope, this is also a material omission, and the ballot will be rejected.  
*	The B envelope does not have to be sealed.  

2. The B envelope must be completed correctly.  It must contain:
*	Voter’s name
*	Voter’s address 
*	Voter’s signature
*	Witness signature

3.  A date is NOT required.

4.  The information on the B envelope is very important.  
*	EO#1 will use the information on the B envelope to determine if any material omissions are present.
*	The information on the B envelope is used to find a voter in the EPB.  NOTE:  Do not use the information on the outer mailer’s return address label to find a voter on the EPB.  Usually the B envelope and the outer mailer information will be the same…but not always.  Sometimes married couples mix up their envelopes, etc.
