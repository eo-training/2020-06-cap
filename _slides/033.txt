Title: "Rejecting a Ballot"
---
During processing operations, unfortunately, you will come across B envelopes that contain material omissions.  In other words, these B envelopes are incomplete (missing names, addresses, signatures) or incorrectly filled out (incorrect name, out of state address, etc.). This voter submission must be rejected.

EO#1 notes that the voter’s B envelope contains a material omission.  He advises EO#2; EO#2 verifies that the material omission is present.  If there is a discrepancy in opinion, CALL THE CHIEF.

EO#2 finds the voter in the EPB in the usual manner.  After selecting the correct voter to get to the voter’s detail page, EO#2 clicks on the rejected flag (in the upper right-hand corner of voter’s detail page). Then selects "Check Voter In".  The confirmation screen appears; clicks on Confirm.

If you check a voter in and then realize you did not check the rejected flag, click on the voter’s name to return to that voter’s detail page.  Check the Rejected flag and select the "Back To List" button on the lower right-hand corner of the voter’s detail page.  You will return to the original list of voters. The voter’s ballot will now show as rejected.

If you mistakenly reject a ballot, click on the voter’s name to return to the voter’s detail page.  Remove the Rejected flag and select the "Back To List" button on the lower right-hand corner of the voter’s detail page.  You will return to the original list of voters.  The rejected status has been removed.
