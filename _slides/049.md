Title: “Write-in Certification”
---

The Recording Officer records the name of each valid write-in candidate on the Write-in Certification sheet.  The Write-in Certification sheet contains all of the contests on the ballot.  A valid name is written each time the Ballot Officer reads it. 
 
Invalid names such as cartoon characters are not written down, but a tally mark is made instead in the “Invalid Candidates” box for that contest.  If the Ballot Officer is not certain a write-in name is invalid, he/she can discuss the name with the Verifying and Recording Officers.
