This is an example of a Voter's Detail Page.

Locate the green "Check Voter In" button in the bottom left hand corner.  When a voter has submitted a complete and correct B envelope, you will select the Check in Voter button.

Locate the "Rejected" flag in the upper right-hand corner.  If a voter's B envelope is incomplete or incorrect (i.e. contains material omissions), first click on the rejected flag, then select the Check Voter In button.

This will be explained in greater detail later in the training.
