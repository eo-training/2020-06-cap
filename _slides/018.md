Title: “Electronic Pollbook - EPB”
- - -
The Electronic Poll Book (EPB) contains information on ALL registered voters in Fairfax County.  Voter information is downloaded onto a thumbdrive from the state-wide voter data base not later than the Monday morning before election day.

In CAP, however, we are only interested in the registered Fairfax County voters who have applied for and received authorization to Vote By Mail.
  
Because the data is downloaded before election day, you may encounter a voter whose name is not on the EPB.  In such a case, CALL THE CHIEF. 
 
The chief will set up the EPB before election officers arrive on election day.  During the day, NEVER close the EPB lid, log off, or turn the computer off.

Also, note the thumbdrive in the image above.  Be careful that this thumbdrive does not become dislodged during the day.
