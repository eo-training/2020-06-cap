Additional training resources are available on displayed link  [note – we don’t really have any other CAP resources except the manual right now, so should the link be to the EO manual]

As a full-fledged election officer, you can use the Election Officer Portal to indicate your availability each election, enroll in training and check your CAP assignment.
