The Request for Assistance form has 3 sections.
1.	 Instructions: 
*  If the voter or his assistant chooses “Yes, I need assistance”, the assistant must complete both the form and the B envelope correctly.
*  If the voter chooses “No”, the blue form may be returned blank, but the voter must complete the B envelope correctly.

2.	 Voter Information:  The assistant must complete this section.  “Unable to Sign” or “Blind Voter” must appear on the voter signature line.  In some instances, the voter may actually sign on the signature line.  If the voter provides his signature on the form, he must also sign the B envelope.

3.	Assistant’s Information:  Name, address, and signature of assistant must appear on the form.  

If the form is complete and correct, the voter’s signature can be missing from the B envelope, but no other material omissions may be present.
