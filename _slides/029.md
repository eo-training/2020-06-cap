title: "Checking in the voter on the EPB"
---
Let's put the previous information together to check in the voter on an EPB.

Elisabeth Marie Ambrose has submitted a mailed-in absentee ballot.  Her B envelope is correct and complete. 
 
EO#1 reads the first two or three letters of the last name on the B envelope:  "am".  EO#2 types "am" into the last name field and clicks on the green search button (or hits the enter key).

A list of possible voters appears.  EO#2 finds the correct voter and looks for the AB icon in front of the voter's name. Her absentee status is "MARKED". Remember, this status must read Issued or Marked for you to proceed.

EO #2 then selects the correct voter by clicking on the voter's name. "Ambrose,  Elizabeth Marie".
