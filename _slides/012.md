A new state law requires CAP to process all mailed-in absentee ballots that are postmarked by election day and arrive at the election office by noon on the Friday after election day.

From Wednesday through Friday, EOs will conduct the same activities they did on election day prior to close of the poll, such as processing or handcounting ballots.
