Title: “Acceptable Names”
- - -
Let’s take a moment to discuss what is acceptable in the name field on the B envelope.  To demonstrate, we will use a voter named Robert Matthew Jones. 
 
The voter must include his full first name and full last name.  For example: Jones, Robert.
  
However, a voter may provide only the initial of his first name if a full middle name is included. For example:   Jones, R. Matthew.

The voter may include his name in an order different than “last, first, middle”.

A middle name is not required or a middle initial may be substituted. For example:  Jones Robert M.

A voter may provide a recognized nickname.  For example Jones, Bob.

Be cautious when generational suffixes ( Jr., Sr., I, II, III) are included.  Ensure that you are checking in the correct voter.
