title: "Ballot Processing Teams - 2 EOs"
---

On election day, ballot processing is completed by teams of 2 election officers.  It is a best practice to become familiar with the responsibilities and functions of each team member, allowing for flexibility during the day.

EO#1 is the Check-in Officer.  The Check-in officer will review the information on the B envelope to determine whether the information is complete.  The Check in officer will also clearly read the name and address of the absentee voter from the B envelope to...

EO#2, who is the EPB Officer.  The EPB Officer locates the correct absentee voter in the electronic poll book, verifies that the information on the voter's B envelope is correct, and checks the voter in on the EPB. EO#2 then opens the B envelope (only from voters whose B envelopes were complete and correct), removes the ballot, and places the ballot, ALWAYS FOLDED, in the ballot box.
